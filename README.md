## RoadMap:
  - [x] 1. Build Responsive Angular4 login frontend
  - [x] 2. Add REST request components
  - [x] 3. Host Mongo database on Atlas and connect it to Nodejs Server
  - [x] 4. Deploy NodeJS server to Heroku
  - [x] 5. Deploy Angular web app to Firebase
  - [ ] 6. Implement password hashing to server
  - [ ] 7. Unit tests on Angular frontend using Karma-Jasmine
  - [ ] 8. Unit tests on Nodejs server using Mocha, Chai and Sinon
  - [ ] 9. Integration Test using Protractor

## Deployment
* Angular4 frontend is hosted at Firebase
* NodeJS Server is hosted at Heroku
* Mongo Dababase is hosted at Atlas
